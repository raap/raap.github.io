We report data based on postcode as they are publicly adopted by people
and business. They also have a hierarchy - area, district, sector. The hierarchy
allows to aggregate data on various data volume and compare different areas,
districts, and sectors.

In maps and reports, you can aggregate data based on regions (Greater London,
East Midlands, ... ). 

<div class="note warning">
Our regions don't align with real region boundaries.
We made a rough approximation and assigned each postcode area
to one region only.

Postcode boundaries occasionally change. We use postcode boundaries from 2012.
